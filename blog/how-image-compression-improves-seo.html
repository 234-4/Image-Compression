  <h1>How Image Compression Improves SEO</h1>
  <p>Complete Guide to Faster Rankings & Better Performance</p>
</header>

<main>

  <p>
    Website speed, user experience, and search engine rankings are closely connected.
    One of the most overlooked but powerful SEO techniques is <strong>image compression</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Image Compression?</h2>
  <p>
    Image compression is the process of reducing an image’s file size without significantly affecting visual quality.
    This improves website performance and loading speed.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Image Compression Matters for SEO</h2>
  <p>
    Google prioritizes fast, user-friendly websites. Large image files slow down pages and negatively impact rankings.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Faster Page Speed (Major Ranking Factor)</h2>
  <p>
    Page speed is a confirmed Google ranking factor. Compressed images load faster,
    reduce server load, and improve user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Improved Core Web Vitals</h2>
  <p>
    Image optimization directly impacts Core Web Vitals such as LCP, CLS, and INP.
    Faster image loading improves these metrics significantly.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Better Mobile SEO Performance</h2>
  <p>
    Google uses mobile-first indexing. Compressed images load quickly on mobile devices,
    improving rankings and reducing bounce rate.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Lower Bounce Rate & Higher Engagement</h2>
  <p>
    Slow pages drive users away. Optimized images help visitors stay longer,
    increasing engagement and SEO performance.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Improved Crawl Budget</h2>
  <p>
    Smaller pages allow search engines to crawl more content efficiently,
    which improves indexing and visibility.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Better Image Search Rankings</h2>
  <p>
    Optimized images rank better in Google Images when combined with proper file names,
    ALT text, and compression.
  </p>

  <h2>Best Image Formats for SEO</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JPG / JPEG</strong> – Best for photos</li>
    <li><strong>PNG</strong> – Logos and transparency</li>
    <li><strong>WebP</strong> – Best overall format for SEO</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Does Image Compression Reduce Quality?</h2>
  <p>
    When done correctly, image compression does not noticeably reduce quality.
    Modern tools balance size reduction with visual clarity.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Verdict: Image Compression & SEO</h2>
  <p>
    Image compression is essential for modern SEO. Faster loading times,
    better Core Web Vitals, and improved user experience lead to higher rankings.
